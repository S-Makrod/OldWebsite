## Remarks on Old Website

Looking back at when I made this website I think a lot could have been done differently. For example, the design could have been simplified so that the responsive layout would be easier to implement. Making a few small changes would have led to a cleaner, easier to implement website but this did give me a solid foundation in HTML and CSS.

I decided to take the time to implement these changes, I researched more on element placement and I was able to make my CSS much cleaner, overall I am happy with the change.
