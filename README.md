# Remarks

Looking back at when I made this website I think a lot could have been done differently. For example, the design could have been simplified so that the responsive layout would be easier to implement. Making a few small changes would have led to a cleaner, easier to implement website but this did give me a solid foundation in HTML and CSS.
