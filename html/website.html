            <p>A video and image carousel are a bit redundant here. Look around the website some more!</p>

            <h2>The Development Journey</h2>

            <p>
                This website was made in July 2021. I first began this website by making wireframes for both my mobile and 
				desktop view (I encourage you to check out both!). After making the wireframes I began to decide on my font,
				colour scheme and additional aspects that were not covered by the wireframes. I then began to code out the html 
				and css of each of my website pages. I spent time researching many aspects such as how to embed videos and position
				my elements as I wanted. After I was done I implemented the JavaScript for my image carousel and other features 
				of my website. Once I was satisfied with my design I published the website on my Github as you see today.

            </p>

            <h2>Remarks</h2>

            <p>
                This is the website you see before you and honestly I am quite proud of it. I developed this website not only 
				for myself but to complete the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design" target="_blank"> Web Design for Everybody Specialization</a>
				on Coursera. I enjoyed every part of it from deciding on my colour scheme to implemeting my image carousel. I will continue
				to keep this website up to date as I continue my career.
