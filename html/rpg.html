            <h2>The Development Journey</h2>

            <p>
                When I began to make this project in June 2020 I first researched about what components I needed to implement 
                this game properly. I took the time to decide on what characteristics my player should have (sword slashes and
                magic), how the monsters would operate, and if I wanted to implement a boss monster. I also found all my resources
                before beginnig to code, for example I edited pictures using Gimp and choose background music from 
                <a href="https://www.bensound.com" target="_blank">Bensound</a>. After coming up with a plan for what I wanted to 
                build, I started to decide how I would implement the code. I broke my code into classes to promote encapsulation
                and readability of my code. After implementing these classes I created the interface for my GUI and implemented timers and the
                keyListener class. Finally once I was satisfied with the ability my program had to interact with the user I began
                testing the program and ultimately completed the game.                
            </p>

            <h2>Remarks</h2>

            <p>
                Looking back at this game after maturing my Java coding skills I do see a lot that could have been done differently
                to make the code better. Although this was a good way to cement my understanding of Java OOP if I wrote this code today
                I would do it differently. For example I would implement a Singleton design pattern for the Player since I only have one 
                instance of the player during the game. I would also extract the monsters from the Map class just like I did with the BossMonster 
                class and then I would implement the factory design pattern. The factory pattern would make the monster spawnning much cleaner.
                I would also consider taking out the powerups (lives, swords, magic) and implementing them with the factory design pattern as well.
                Using these design patterns would make my code much more readable and it would improve the quality of my RPG game.
            </p>
